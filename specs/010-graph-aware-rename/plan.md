# Implementation Plan: Graph-Aware Rename

**Branch**: `010-graph-aware-rename` | **Date**: 2026-07-11 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/010-graph-aware-rename/spec.md`

**Design authority**: `docs/ai/specs/.process/SPEC-010-design-concept.md` (Q1–Q11) and the spec's three Clarify sessions are binding. This plan implements those decisions and introduces no new architecture beyond them; any place it must extend a decision is called out as a **revision note** (none required — see Constitution Check).

## Summary

Turn CodeGraph's "who references X" knowledge into a *safe write*: rename any indexed symbol with a dry-run plan first, LSP-powered where a language server covers the language and graph-reference-derived otherwise, span-verified against live file bytes always, and atomic-through-verification on apply. Delivered as **two vertical slices** behind a new `src/refactor/` module (fork discipline, Principle III):

- **Slice 1 (read-only)** — the plan engine, name+qualifier targeting with candidate-listing/kind refusals, per-edit confidence tiers (FR-004 table), plan-time span verification, and the `codegraph rename` CLI in unconditional dry-run. A complete, zero-write-risk capability (~200 reviewable LOC).
- **Slice 2 (write)** — the apply safety ladder (confidence gate → live-byte span re-verify → per-edit symlink-jail + scope-matcher → in-memory snapshots + temp-file-atomic-rename write → resolution-complete targeted re-sync → touched-file post-check → unconditional rollback, with a failed-rollback recovery dump as the sole malfunction), plus the always-exposed `codegraph_rename` MCP tool and the agent-guidance paragraph (~200 reviewable LOC).

Technical approach: the plan is **recomputed on apply** from the live index (no persisted plan artifact, Q2); the derivation order per language is *configured+available LSP server → `textDocument/rename` workspace edit → RenameEdit[]*, else *graph `references` edges for the resolved target node → live-byte span-verified → tier-assigned*. The apply gate is **all-exact-or-refuse** with an explicit `--include-heuristic` escape (Q3). Every expected/recoverable condition is **success-shaped** on both surfaces (Principle VI); only a failed rollback restore is `isError`/exit-4 (FR-019a). Offsets are **UTF-16 code units end-to-end** (SPEC-008 pin) — no byte↔UTF-16 translation anywhere.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (strict). Node engines `>=20 <25`; effective from-source floor Node 22.5 for `node:sqlite`. No language/toolchain change.

**Primary Dependencies** (all existing — no new runtime dependency, Principle VII):
- `src/lsp/` (SPEC-008) — `LspJsonRpcClient` generic `request(method, params)` carries `textDocument/rename`; per-language `EffectiveLspConfig` + server-availability probe (`probeLspServerCommand`) decide the LSP-vs-graph fork, and an unavailable server or a runtime failure (`server-crash`/`initialize-timeout`/`request-timeout`/`malformed-protocol-response`/`shutdown-failure`, SPEC-008's `degraded` category) degrades *that* rename to the graph path rather than failing the command — SPEC-008 per-language degradation parity (FR-003a); SPEC-008 UTF-16 position-mapping helpers map rename positions and returned edit ranges.
- `src/db/` — `QueryBuilder` prepared statements over `node:sqlite`; new statements added here, never inline SQL.
- `src/resolution/` — `resolvedBy` category + `provenance` on `references` edges drive the FR-004 tier assignment.
- `src/index.ts` — `CodeGraph` class: `sync()` targeted re-sync (resolution-complete path) for the post-check; thin public entry points for plan/apply.
- `src/mcp/` — `tools.ts` tool registry + `ToolHandler.execute` error-shaping; `server-instructions.ts` single-source agent guidance.
- `src/bin/codegraph.ts` — commander CLI.

**Storage**: `node:sqlite` (WAL + FTS5) via `QueryBuilder`. Reads only from the graph (`references` edges, node declaration spans, provenance/`resolvedBy`); the apply path writes **source files**, never new schema. No migration, no new table, no new column.

**Testing**: vitest in `__tests__/`; real files + real SQLite (no DB mocking); `fs.mkdtempSync` temp projects with `afterEach` cleanup. Platform-divergent assertions gated with `it.runIf` (Windows deferred, Q10). Bug-class checks start red then green (Principle IV). A/B retrieval no-regression harness (`scripts/agent-eval/`) for Slice 2.

**Target Platform**: macOS (dev + default `npm test`) and Dockerized Linux validated in v1; **Windows deferred** (VM suspended, Q10) — write path stays on cross-platform Node `fs`; byte-exact span verification turns CRLF/encoding drift into a safe refusal rather than corruption; a Windows pass is a tracked UAT follow-up.

**Project Type**: single project — a local-first library + CLI + MCP server (not web/mobile).

**Performance Goals**: no retrieval regression on a control repo when the MCP tool joins the default-served set (A/B, ≥2 runs/arm, Sonnet floor model — FR-024/SC-007). Plan derivation is a bounded set of prepared-statement reads plus one LSP round-trip (LSP path) or one span-verify pass over the touched files (graph path) — interactive latency, no stated throughput target.

**Constraints**: no new runtime dependency; pure-JS; no network beyond locally spawned language servers (Principle VII). UTF-16 code units end-to-end (SPEC-008). Diffs to upstream-owned files (`src/db/queries.ts`, `src/mcp/tools.ts`, `src/mcp/server-instructions.ts`, `src/bin/codegraph.ts`, `src/index.ts`) stay minimal and additive; all new logic lives in `src/refactor/` (Principle III).

**Scale/Scope**: ~405 net-new reviewable LOC, ~200 per slice; 12 new `src/refactor/` modules (8 Slice 1 + 4 Slice 2) as the single primary surface, plus 5 additive edits to upstream-owned files and 3 test files (~20 total).

**Reviewability Budget**: **Primary surface** — harness/adapter (`src/refactor/` plan-and-apply engine), 12 new modules (8 in Slice 1 + 4 in Slice 2). **Secondary surfaces** — CLI (`rename` subcommand), MCP tool, agent-guidance text (5 additive edits to upstream-owned files). **Projected reviewable LOC** ~405 (~200/slice). **Production files** — 12 new `src/refactor/` modules + 5 additive upstream edits. **Total files** ~20 (incl. 3 test files). **Budget result**: **warn** — reviewable LOC 405 > 400, and the 12-module primary surface exceeds the 8-file block threshold *as a single PR*; both are **resolved by the ratified 2-slice split exception** (Q11 — the preset waives the block "unless a ratified split exception exists"). Each slice ships independently at ~200 reviewable LOC (< 400), single primary surface: Slice 1's 8 new modules warn (> 6) but do not block (≤ 8), Slice 2's 4 pass.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: evaluated before Phase 0 and re-affirmed after Phase 1 design. Result: PASS on all seven principles; Complexity Tracking is empty.*

| Principle | Assessment | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **I. Think Before Coding** | Every branch is resolved upstream: design concept Q1–Q11 + Clarify Session 1 (FR-004 tier table), Session 2 (apply mechanics FR-017/FR-018/FR-019a/FR-020), Session 3 (surfaces FR-026/FR-027/FR-028). Spec carries zero `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`. Three Open Questions (Windows validation, positional escape-hatch, tier boundary) are each **closed**: two are explicit deferrals with tracked follow-ups, the tier boundary is resolved by FR-004. | PASS |
| **II. Simplicity First** | Recompute-on-apply → no plan-file format to version/invalidate (Q2). Unconditional rollback → no `--keep-partial` second code path (Q5). No `--position` targeting flag (Q6), no `--include-docs` (Q9). All-exact gate is one boolean, not a configurable threshold (Q3, FR-004 "fixed exclusion, not runtime-configurable"). Reuse of the existing symlink-containment check and the shared scope matcher (FR-017) instead of a bespoke jail. No speculative abstraction. | PASS |
| **III. Surgical Changes** | New capability isolated in `src/refactor/` (a new module, matching the fork-discipline corollary listing `src/lsp`, `src/analysis`, …). Upstream-owned files receive only additive, minimal edits (one CLI subcommand; one MCP tool + one default-served-list entry; one guidance paragraph; thin `index.ts` entry points). No refactor of unrelated code. | PASS |
| **IV. Goal-Driven Execution** | Each FR maps to an acceptance scenario and a measurable SC. Tests precede implementation; the self-repo dogfood UAT (SC-009) and the A/B evidence (SC-007) are completion gates, not vibes. `npm run build && npm test` green is the floor. | PASS |
| **V. Deterministic, LLM-Free Extraction** | Rename edits derive only from LSP workspace edits or span-verified graph references — no LLM anywhere. `provenance='heuristic'` synthesized edges are **never** emitted as edits (their stored position is a dispatch site), only counted in the leftover-mention FYI (FR-004/FR-013). No new edges are written to the graph; node/edge counts stay stable across rename + re-sync (no index explosion), verified by the before/after count probe SC-010 rather than left as an unchecked "by design" claim. | PASS |
| **VI. Retrieval Performance Is a Regression Surface** | Adding `codegraph_rename` grows the default-served set from 1 to 2 tools — gated by an A/B no-regression run on a control repo (FR-024/SC-007), in Slice 2 only. Every recoverable refusal is success-shaped (FR-023); `isError` is reserved for the single failed-rollback malfunction (FR-019a). Guidance keeps `codegraph_explore` PRIMARY and must not dilute explore-first steering (FR-025). The `retrieval-guardian` review is applicable (diff touches `src/mcp/`). | PASS |
| **VII. Local-First, Private, Zero Native Dependencies** | No new runtime dependency; `node:sqlite` unchanged; pure-JS write path on Node `fs`. No network beyond locally spawned language servers. No new SQL/WASM/asset to wire into `copy-assets`. | PASS |

**Reviewability gate**: single primary surface (`src/refactor/`). *As a single PR* two thresholds are exceeded — reviewable LOC (405 > 400 warn) and the 12-module primary surface (> 8 production-file block); both are covered by the **ratified 2-slice split exception** (Q11), which the preset admits ("block above … 8 production files … unless a ratified split exception exists"). Per slice each ships independently at ~200 reviewable LOC (< 400) and one primary surface — Slice 1's 8 new modules warn (> 6) but stay ≤ the 8-file block, Slice 2's 4 pass; total files ~20 (< 25). **Result: WARN, resolved by the ratified split — not blocked.** (The seven-principle Constitution Check above is unaffected — this is gate evidence, not a Principle I–VII verdict.)

**PR review packet source** (per slice): what changed, why, non-goals, review order (Slice 1 engine → CLI; Slice 2 apply ladder → MCP → guidance), scope budget, the FR→file→evidence traceability matrix, verification evidence (`npm test`, probes, and — Slice 2 — the A/B numbers + self-repo dogfood outcome), known gaps (Windows validation), and rollback/flag notes (Slice 2 is the write increment; `--include-heuristic` is the only behavior escape).

### Source Code (repository root)

New logic is confined to `src/refactor/`. The file layout makes the **slice boundary a clean PR boundary** — **at the Slice-1 PR boundary no Slice-1 file imports a Slice-2 file** (Slice 1 ships self-contained and read-only); Slice 2 imports Slice 1 (notably `span-verify.ts`, written for plan-time FR-005 and reused for apply-time FR-016) and additively adds one plan-time cross-import (`plan-engine.ts` → `jail.ts`, T040) that lands inside the Slice-2 PR.

```

**Structure Decision**: Single-project layout. The plan/apply engine is a **new `src/refactor/` module** (fork discipline — new capabilities go in new modules, keeping upstream-owned files' diffs routine). The intra-module split is by slice: the eight Slice-1 files form a self-contained read-only plan engine that the CLI dry-run drives; the four Slice-2 files add the write ladder that the `--apply` CLI path and the MCP tool drive. `span-verify.ts` is the deliberate shared seam (Slice 1 owns it; Slice 2 reuses it), so the two live-byte verifications required by FR-004/FR-005/FR-016 are one implementation. All surface edits (CLI, MCP, `index.ts`, server-instructions) are additive; `QueryBuilder` gains prepared statements in both slices but no schema changes anywhere.
