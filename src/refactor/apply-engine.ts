/**
 * SPEC-010 Slice-2 apply safety ladder — the engine (FR-014 → FR-020 / FR-019a).
 *
 * Composes the Rung seams in the CONTRACTUAL runtime order (data-model.md
 * "ApplyOutcome — state transitions"); each gate either advances or exits to one
 * of the four terminal {@link ApplyOutcome}s, so every apply resolves to exactly
 * one state (SC-002):
 *
 *   recompute plan (FR-014)      {@link planRename} — the LIVE index, no persisted artifact
 *     → confidence gate (FR-015) any below-`exact` edit + no includeHeuristic → refused:heuristic-gated
 *     → jail / scope (FR-017)    {@link checkPlanJail} → refused:out-of-root | scope-ignored
 *     → snapshot (FR-018/FR-020) {@link takeSnapshots} — in-memory bytes, before any write
 *     → span re-verify (FR-016)  {@link reverifySpans} → refused:stale-span (ZERO writes)
 *     → atomic write (FR-020)    {@link writeEdits}; an LSP-set overlap re-derives via graph ONCE (FR-003a)
 *     → re-sync (FR-018)         the injected `sync`; the lock-failure zero-shape → rollback
 *     → post-check (FR-018)      {@link runPostCheck}; a dangle → rollback
 *     → applied                  post-check green (exit 0)
 *
 * Rollback (FR-019): restore every touched file byte-identically from its
 * snapshot, re-sync, and report the dangles → `rolled-back`; a restore that itself
 * fails (FR-019a) → `rollback-failed` carrying the recovery dump — the SOLE
 * error-shaped terminal on this surface (FR-023), never re-syncing a workspace
 * left in an unknown partial state.
 *
 * Dependency-injected exactly like {@link planRename} (the graph handle, project
 * root, resolved LSP config) plus the resolution-complete re-sync as an injected
 * `sync` fn, so `CodeGraph.applyRename` (T041) stays a thin wrapper. No global
 * state; every edit path is resolved against `projectRoot`.
